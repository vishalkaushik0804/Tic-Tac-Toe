# Tic-Tac-Toe
TicTacToe is based on the classic board game, also known as "noughts and crosses" with two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.
It is a two players game in which each player turn by turn enters the input just by clicking on the one of the nine grid block.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
